# Ledger latency benchmark

This is the measured answer to the one claim [SCOPE.md](../SCOPE.md) flagged as
"a design target, not yet shown": **can the formally-proven credit ledger sit on
the synchronous hot path (target p99 < 50 ms)?** The ledger's *correctness* is
proven (Z3, zero double-posting); this document measures its *speed*, honestly,
and states plainly where the measurement lands relative to the target.

**Headline, stated without spin: the p50 is fast (ledger TransactWriteItems
p50 = 20 ms, end-to-end authorize p50 = 57 ms), but the p99 does NOT meet the
< 50 ms target — the ledger write alone is p99 = 58 ms even with zero
contention, and the end-to-end p99 is 225 ms. The bottleneck is not CPU (the
task never saturated) and not the client; it is the DynamoDB `TransactWriteItems`
tail plus, under concurrency on a single tenant pool row, the application's
optimistic-CAS retry.** See [Interpretation](#interpretation).

## What was measured

`POST /api/mvp/billing/authorize` — the external-authorize path that reserves a
dollar amount from a tenant pool with a single synchronous DynamoDB
`TransactWriteItems` (pool CAS + HOLD put + RESERVE ledger event + idempotency
row). It does **not** call Bedrock, so it is the isolated cost of putting the
ledger on the hot path. Two layers:

- **A (end-to-end, headline):** an in-region client → ALB → Fargate → DynamoDB,
  over a persistent keep-alive connection.
- **Server-side ledger span (decomposition):** the wall-clock of the
  `TransactWriteItems` call itself, logged as `ledger_transact_latency` on the
  committed path (permanent telemetry, `mvp/_pipeline.py`), so the ledger
  round-trip is separable from the HTTP/ALB shell.

## Interval definition (stated so nothing is hidden)

> **A-layer interval:** from sending the request on an already-established
> keep-alive connection to receiving the final response byte. **Includes** ALB +
> Fargate app + DynamoDB round-trip. **Excludes** TLS/connection setup (a real
> proxy client reuses connections) and CloudFront / WAN (unrelated to ledger
> speed — measuring through it would measure geography, not the ledger).
>
> The load generator is a same-region (us-east-1) EC2 in a **different VPC** than
> the target, reaching the ALB by public DNS (CloudFront excluded). This adds a
> VPC-crossing hop, measured directly: **TCP connect p50 = 0.90 ms, p99 = 2.27 ms,
> max = 7.6 ms (n = 1000)**. The hop stays within the AWS backbone (no WAN) and
> its bias is **conservative** — it can only make the measured latency worse, so
> a passing result would be understated, not inflated. It is disclosed here
> rather than hidden.
>
> **Server-span interval:** wall-clock of `TransactWriteItems` inside the app.
> No HTTP stack.

## Environment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Measured commit | `f0bab1c` (ledger-latency telemetry) on `feat/credit-ledger-phase1` |
| Backend image | `scverify-backend:v51` (amd64) |
| Task size | ECS Fargate **256 CPU units (0.25 vCPU)**, 512 MiB — the real deployed size |
| Region / tables | us-east-1, DynamoDB **PAY_PER_REQUEST** (`scverify-tenant-budgets`, `scverify-credit-ledger`) |
| Logging | `ENVIRONMENT=production` (JSON, INFO). See the note below on a development-logging finding. |
| Rate limit | `BILLING_WRITE_RATE_LIMIT` relaxed to `100000/minute` for the bench (production default is `60/minute`; a rate limit is an abuse policy, not a performance component — relaxing it does not change what is measured, and it is disclosed here). |
| Load generator | zenn3s EC2 (us-east-1f, c7i.4xlarge, different VPC), keep-alive, CloudFront excluded |
| Tenant | a single tenant pool row (`default-org`) — see the contention note |

A finding worth recording: the environment was initially running
`ENVIRONMENT=development`, which selects console logging at **DEBUG** level and
made botocore emit per-request debug output. That is both a benchmark
contaminant and a mis-configuration for a production-like environment; the bench
was re-run under `ENVIRONMENT=production` (JSON/INFO) and all numbers below are
from that configuration.

## Results

### Floor — zero contention (concurrency = 1)

The lowest latency the design can reach: one request at a time, no CAS
contention. This is the number no amount of tuning can beat.

| Interval | n | p50 | p90 | p99 | p99.9 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ledger `TransactWriteItems` (server span) | 3,734 | **20 ms** | 27 ms | **58 ms** | 166 ms | 245 ms |
| End-to-end authorize (A-layer) | 3,639 | **57 ms** | 78 ms | **225 ms** | 356 ms | 395 ms |

Decomposition at p50: of the 57 ms end-to-end, ~20 ms is the ledger round-trip
and ~37 ms is ALB + app + network (of which the VPC-crossing hop is ~1 ms; the
rest is app processing on 0.25 vCPU).

### Contention curve — single tenant pool row (worst case), 0.25 vCPU

All load aimed at ONE pool row. This is the **worst case by construction**: a
multi-tenant workload spreads across partition keys, so per-tenant contention is
strictly better than this curve. Multi-tenant aggregate performance was **not
measured** (see [Not measured](#not-measured)).

| Concurrency | n | e2e p50 | e2e p99 | e2e max | error rate | server-span p99 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (floor) | 3,639 | 57 ms | 225 ms | 395 ms | 0% | 58 ms |
| 2 | 379 | 206 ms | 1,953 ms | 2,515 ms | 1.3% | 51 ms |
| 8 | 360 | 855 ms | 4,903 ms | 5,611 ms | 2.4% | — |
| 16 | 470 | 989 ms | 6,512 ms | 8,589 ms | 6.2% | — |

The key signal: from c=1 to c=2 the **server-side `TransactWriteItems` p99
barely moved (58 → 51 ms)**, yet the **end-to-end p99 exploded (225 → 1,953 ms)**.
The degradation is therefore NOT DynamoDB — it is the application's
optimistic-CAS retry (snapshot re-read + full-jitter backoff) on the single hot
pool row. A single pool row is a structural hot spot under concurrency.

### After: headroom ADD gate (same worst case, re-measured)

The snapshot-all-equal CAS above was replaced with a single conditional ADD to a
derived `pool_headroom_microusd` counter (see
[../design/ledger-hot-path.md](../design/ledger-hot-path.md)). The reserve's
condition now references only the counter it mutates, so a concurrent reserve
that still fits no longer invalidates the others — the snapshot-invalidation
`ConditionalCheckFailed` storm cannot occur. Re-measured on the same ALB and the
same in-region load-gen host, same single hot pool row:

| Concurrency | e2e p50 (before → after) | e2e p99 (before → after) | error rate (before → after) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2  | 206 → 151 ms   | 1,953 → 556 ms   | 1.3% → **0%** |
| 8  | 855 → 480 ms   | 4,903 → 2,112 ms | 2.4% → **0%** |
| 16 | 989 → 860 ms   | 6,512 → 4,508 ms | 6.2% → **0%** |

What changed, stated plainly:

- **The contention error rate went to zero at every step** (6.2% → 0% at c=16).
  The snapshot-invalidation storm — the thing that made concurrent reserves fail
  and retry — is gone, exactly as the design intended.
- **p99 improved materially under contention** (c=2 −72%, c=8 −57%, c=16 −31%).
- **But single-row p99 still climbs steeply with concurrency and still misses the
  target.** The projected "6,512 → ~200 ms" in the design doc was **NOT met**:
  measured c=16 p99 is 4,508 ms. The reason is exactly the residual the design
  doc flagged (finding 1): the reserve item is composed into a multi-item
  `TransactWriteItems`, so two reserves on the *same* pool row still collide at
  the transaction layer with reason `TransactionConflict` and the caller still
  bounded-retries. Headroom removed the application-CAS storm; it did **not** make
  a single hot row's p99 flat. Flattening that tail is the next step's job (the
  two-item transaction + Streams-derived events), not this change's.

(The after-run's c=1 step was a short 45 s sample and is not comparable to the
long dedicated floor run above; the floor p99 = 58 ms is unchanged by this
change, as the design predicted.) Raw CSVs: `bench/ledger-latency/results/headroom_c{1,2,8,16}.csv`.

### CPU is not the limiter

During the runs, ECS service `CPUUtilization` averaged 7–37 % (max 52–84 %) — the
0.25 vCPU task never saturated. Raising vCPU would not move the p99: the floor
p99 is the DynamoDB `TransactWriteItems` tail, and the contention p99 is
application CAS retry, neither of which is CPU-bound.

### Invariant audit — correct under the contention storm

After all runs (including the c=16 storm with a 6.2 % error rate), every HOLD row
for the tenant was distinct: **1,376 hold rows, 1,376 distinct, 0 duplicates.**
A failed authorize (the errors above) created no hold — the `TransactWriteItems`
is atomic — and no successful authorize created two. **Zero double-reserve held
through the storm.** This is the half a "fast" number alone cannot show: the
ledger is not just measured for speed, it is measured for correctness *under the
same load*, and the correctness invariant survived.

## Interpretation

Against the target (p99 < 50 ms), read honestly:

- **p50 is fast and on-target-ish** (ledger 20 ms, e2e 57 ms).
- **p99 misses the target**, even at the zero-contention floor (ledger 58 ms,
  e2e 225 ms), and misses badly under single-row contention.
- The miss is **not** fixable by scaling the task (CPU is idle) or the client.
  The floor p99 is the DynamoDB `TransactWriteItems` tail; the contention p99 is
  the single-pool-row optimistic-CAS retry.

So the benchmark's job is done — not by proving "< 50 ms", but by turning the
target into a **measured design signal**: to hit p99 < 50 ms on the hot path,
the design must change, and the data points at where —

1. **Reduce the ledger tail:** the four-item `TransactWriteItems` has a tail
   that a single-item conditional `UpdateItem` (where the money-move allows it)
   would not; or accept the reserve as eventually-durable and move part of it
   off the synchronous path.
2. **Remove the single-row hot spot:** shard the tenant pool row (e.g. N
   sub-counters reconciled) so concurrent authorizes for one tenant do not all
   CAS the same item — this is what the contention curve is really measuring.

These are design changes, not tuning, and choosing among them is follow-up work.
Publishing the miss is the point; engineering a 50 ms number is not.

## Item-count spike — does reducing the transaction to 2 items help? (measured: NO)

The two-item migration's performance premise was "moving the RESERVE ledger event
(and IDEMP row) off the synchronous transaction — 4 items → 2 — shrinks the p99
tail." Before investing the correctness work, that premise was measured directly:
the same real DynamoDB (us-east-1), the same single hot pool row, the same
production item builders, composed into 4- / 3- / 2-item `TransactWriteItems`
variants, with per-transaction attribution (SDK retries, `TransactionConflict`
count). 3,000 sequential + 3,000 concurrent (c=16) per variant. This is a
throwaway spike (correctness intentionally not preserved; bench namespace cleaned
up), run from `bench/ledger-latency/bench_itemcount_spike.py`.

**Floor (c=1, zero contention) — item count barely moves the tail:**

| Transaction | p50 | p99 | p99.9 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4-item (pool + HOLD + RESERVE + IDEMP, today) | 21.9 ms | 90.2 ms | 241 ms | 265 ms |
| 3-item (RESERVE async'd) | 20.6 ms | 60.5 ms | 157 ms | 168 ms |
| 2-item (RESERVE + IDEMP removed) | 19.0 ms | 69.7 ms | 176 ms | 239 ms |

**Single-row contention (c=16) — item count is IRRELEVANT:**

| Transaction | p50 | p99 | max | errors | TransactionConflict total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4-item | 25.5 ms | 1,194 ms | 1,888 ms | 35 | 3,291 |
| 3-item | 23.5 ms | 1,188 ms | 1,954 ms | 35 | 3,325 |
| 2-item | 22.3 ms | 1,189 ms | 1,767 ms | 38 | 3,193 |

**Conclusion (decisive): the two-item migration does NOT, on its own, meet the p99
target.** Neither the floor nor the contention tail responds to item count. The
c=16 p99 is quantized at ~1,190 ms across all three variants because the tail is
100% SDK-backoff accumulation on `TransactionConflict` — the optimistic
serialization of concurrent transactions touching the SAME pool row, which is a
function of *there being a transaction on a hot row*, not of how many items it
carries. (The 3-item < 2-item floor inversion is sampling noise: at n=3,000 the
p99 confidence interval comfortably spans a 10 ms gap.) A further signal: at c=16,
35–38 of 3,000 transactions still FAILED after 8 retries — under a burst past
c=16 the current transactional design does not just get slow, it drops requests.

**What this redirects the design to.** Because the killer is *the transaction
itself* on a hot row, the next measured step is the **PENDING protocol** (design
doc): Put HOLD `PENDING` → a SINGLE conditional `UpdateItem` on the pool row (no
transaction, so no `TransactionConflict` failure mode — concurrent single-item
writes queue at the leader replica rather than cancel) → mark HOLD `ACTIVE`. This
attacks the floor AND the contention tail; sharding (which only divides contention
by N and cannot touch the transaction floor that already misses at c=1) is held as
a composable second stage. Crucially, the two-item migration is NOT abandoned — it
is re-scoped as the **prerequisite path to PENDING** (PENDING's write path touches
only pool + HOLD, so moving RESERVE/IDEMP off the synchronous transaction is a
precondition), and the deployed shadow projector + reconciler become the
drift/orphan safety net that de-transactionalization requires. See
[docs/design/ledger-hot-path.md](../design/ledger-hot-path.md).

## Not measured (the honest limits)

- **Multi-tenant aggregate performance.** Authorize targets the caller's own
  `org_id`, so a multi-tenant spread needs many authenticated principals; not
  built. Only the single-row worst case is measured. Per-tenant latency in a
  real multi-tenant deployment is bounded ABOVE by the contention curve here.
- **Bedrock-path end-to-end.** This measures the pool-only authorize, not an
  inference request.
- **Sustained load / partition-split behaviour** of the PAY_PER_REQUEST tables
  beyond these runs.
- **DynamoDB's own throttling / fault behaviour** — delegated to the AWS SLA;
  not injectable honestly, so not claimed.
- **Task-loss (A-3) resilience** under a *clean* baseline — the single-tenant
  contention already dominates the signal, so a task-kill run was not separated
  out; folded into "not measured" rather than reported as a clean number.

## Reproduce

Scripts: [`bench/ledger-latency/`](../../bench/ledger-latency). Raw per-request
latency CSVs from this run are in
[`bench/ledger-latency/results/`](../../bench/ledger-latency/results) (summary
CSVs; full raw sets were captured on the load host).

1. Deploy a bench rev: `scverify-backend:v51`, `ENVIRONMENT=production`,
   `BILLING_WRITE_RATE_LIMIT=100000/minute`.
2. Confirm the ALB security group; if it is CloudFront-prefix-list-only, add the
   load host's `/32` on the ALB port temporarily (record add/remove times) and
   remove it after.
3. From an in-region host, measure route overhead: `route_overhead.py <alb-dns>`.
4. Floor + curve: `bench_live.py --base-url http://<alb-dns> --token-file <tok>
   --mode a1|a2 --tenants <t> --concurrency <c> --duration-s <s> --out <csv>`.
5. Server span: filter `ledger_transact_latency` from the backend logs for the
   run window.
6. Invariant audit: query the tenant's HOLD rows; assert count == distinct.
7. Tear down: remove the SG rule, restore the flags-off rev.
